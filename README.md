  At least 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year. Plastic pollution has been shown to affect marine wildlife, food safety, as well as tourism. This program will use AI to recognize and quantify elements of plastic pollution. 
  There are plans to provide a display of the quantified pollutants to the public via a mobile application, so they can be made aware and given means to help in clean-up efforts of our oceans.
  
  The AI will be trained to recognise plastic from open-source satellite data of any chosen ocean.
